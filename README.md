### Foreword
The iQMetrix-CT software has been developed within the framework of the French Society of Medical Physics (SFPM) working group entitled *Development of an automated CT image analysis system including image quality metrics adapted to iterative reconstructions*.

### Software description
iQMetrix-CT is designed to quantify CT Image Quality by using so-called advanced metrics such as Noise Power Spectrum (NPS), Task-based Transfer Function (TTF) and detectability index (d').

iQMetrix-CT is suitable for both optimization process and performance monitoring (QC). This software is compatible with images from most commercial scanners, including CBCT devices.

### Prerequisites
version 1.0 : you will need to download the Matlab 2020a runtime

version 1.1 (last stable release) : you will need to download the Matlab 2022a runtime

Matlab runtimes are available here: https://fr.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

The prerequisites for this runtime, and thus the iQMetrix-CT software, to work properly are available here :
